COLLECT LIBRARY:

Data collections.
 
IntervalMap, IntervalSet and LongIntervalMap are collections that provide interval-based indexing. 

RingList, ConcurrentBag, and PublicList provide better performance than java.util alternatives.

SemiWeakHashSet, WeakHashSet, and WeakValueHashMap are collection with weak references to their elements or values.

GroupMap and GroupSet provide multiple indices on a set in a way that most people will find too confusing to bother with.
